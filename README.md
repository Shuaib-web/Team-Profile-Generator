# Team-Profile-Generator
My task was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.
Because this Challenge will require the use of the Inquirer package, I ensured that I installed and used Inquirer version 8.2.4. To do so, I used the following command in your project folder: npm i inquirer@8.2.4.
Testing is key to making code maintainable, so you’ll also write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test.
Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing. You’ll need to submit a link to the video AND add it to the readme of your project.
